# Mental Health Classification Model

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model to predict the level of mood swings in individuals. This model aims to assist doctors and researchers in identifying patients at risk of developing mental health issues.

## Techniques Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or equivalent platform

### Libraries and Packages

- **Scientific Computing and Data Manipulation**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building and evaluating a mood swings classification model. It includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FzBerradi/Mental_Health_Maching_Learning.git
2. Install the required Python libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
4. Open the notebook (Sante_Mentale_Grp4_Mini_Projet_Ai.ipynb) and follow the instructions to execute the cells.
