The goal of this project is to develop a classification model to predict the level of mood swings in individuals. This model aims to assist doctors and researchers in identifying patients at risk of developing mental health issues.

## Techniques Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or equivalent platform

### Libraries and Packages

- **Scientific Computing and Data Manipulation**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building and evaluating a mood swings classification model. It includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
